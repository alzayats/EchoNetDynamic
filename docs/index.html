      <h2>Content</h2>
      <h3>What is this course about?</h3>
      <p>
        What do web search, speech recognition, face recognition, machine translation,
        autonomous driving, and automatic scheduling have in common?
        These are all complex real-world problems,
        and the goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to tackle these
        with rigorous mathematical tools.
        In this course, you will learn the foundational principles that drive these
        applications and practice implementing some of these systems.  Specific
        topics include machine learning, search, game playing, Markov decision
        processes, constraint satisfaction, graphical models, and logic.
        The main goal of the course is to equip you with the tools to tackle new
        AI problems you might encounter in life.
      </p>
      <h3>Prerequisites:</h3>
      <p>
        This course is fast-paced and covers a lot of ground,
        so it is important that you have a solid foundation on both the theoretical and empirical fronts.
        You should have taken the following classes (or their equivalents):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Programming (<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs106a/">CS 106A</a>, <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/">CS 106B</a>, <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs107/">CS 107</a>)</li>
        <li>Discrete math (<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs103/">CS 103</a>)</li>
        <li>Probability (<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs109/">CS 109</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Reading:</h3>
      <p>
        There is no required textbook for this class, and you should be able to
        learn everything from the lecture notes and homeworks.
        However, if you would like to pursue more advanced topics or get another
        perspective on the same material, here are some books:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu">Russell and Norvig.  Artificial
          Intelligence: A Modern Approach.</a> A comprehensive reference for
          all the AI topics that we will cover.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/probabilistic-graphical-models">Koller and Friedman.  Probabilistic Graphical Models.</a>
          Covers factor graphs and Bayesian networks (this is the textbook for CS228).
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning">Sutton and Barto.  Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction.</a>
          Covers Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning.  Available free online.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/">Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman.  The elements of statistical learning.</a>
          Covers machine learning.  Available free online.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.bracil.net/edward/fcs.html">Tsang.  Foundations of constraint satisfaction.</a>
          Covers constraint satisfaction problems.  Available free online.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Bear in mind that some of these books can be quite dense and use different
        notation terminology, so it might take some effort to connect up with the
        material from class.

          <b>Videos</b>:
          There will be weekly homeworks with both written and programming parts.
          Each homework is centered around an application and will also deepen your understanding of the theoretical concepts.
          Some homeworks will have a competition component; winners will receive extra credit.
          Here are all the homework deadlines:
          <div id="homeworks"></div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Tracings</b>: The exam is a three-hour written exam that will
          test your knowledge and problem-solving skills on all preceding lectures and homeworks.
          You cannot use any external aids
          except one double-sided page of notes.
          If you have a conflict or have an OAE exception,
          submit a request on Piazza to take it at another (earlier) time.
          Your request must be submitted by <strong>Tue May 01</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Measurements</b> (20%): The final project provides an opportunity for you to
          use the tools from class to build something interesting of your choice.
          Projects should be done in groups of up to three.
          The project will be something that you work on throughout the course and we have set up some milestones
          to help you along the way:
