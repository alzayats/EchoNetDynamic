Example Writeup
</div>

<p>
Homeworks should be written up clearly and succinctly; you may lose points if your answers
are unclear or unnecessarily complicated.
This is an example of what we are looking for.
</p>

<div class="problemTitle">
Simple Question
</div>

<p>
<b>Question:</b> In big-O notation, how many contiguous subsequences are there of a list of $n$ numbers?
</p>

<div class="solution">
<b>Answer:</b> There are $O(n)$ choices for the starting position of the subsequence
and $O(n)$ choices for the ending position.
Therefore, there are $O(n^2)$ possible contiguous subsequences.
</div>

<p>
Here, using words is precise enough and easy to read.
</p>

<div class="problemTitle">
More Involved Question
</div>

<p>
<b>Question:</b> Suppose you flip a sequence of independent fair coins until you get heads,
and on each preceding tails flip, you roll a 6-sided fair dice.
What is the expected value of the sum of the die?
</p>

<div class="solution">
<b>Answer:</b>
<ul>
<li>Let $Z_1, Z_2, \dots$ be the values of the coin tosses.
<li>Let $X_1, X_2, \dots$ be the values of the dice rolls
(let $X_i=0$ if the $i$th dice was not rolled).
<li>Let $A_i$ be the event that $i$th dice was rolled,
which is exactly when $Z_1, \dots, Z_i$ are all tails.
This happens with probability $\mathbb{P}(A_i) = 2^{-i}$ by independence of the coin flips.
<li>If the $i$th dice is rolled, then expected contribution to the sum is
$\mathbb{E}[X_i|A_i]=3.5$; otherwise, it is zero.
<li>Finally, the expected value of the sum, by linearity of expectation, is
<p style="text-align:center;">$\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\mathbb{E}[X_i] = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}(3.5\cdot 2^{-i}+0) = 3.5$</p>
</div>

<p>
<b>General guidelines:</b>
<ul>
<li>Try to balance mathematical notation and words.
<li>Introduce notation only if you need to refer back to it later in an exact way and words aren't enough.
<li>If you introduce your own notation in the problem, define everything up front.
<li>When you make a statement, it should be clear whether it is assumed from the problem, or derived from a previous step, or something that you're trying to derive.
<li>Regardless of whether you use mathematical notation of words, be clear and precise.
<li>You can break down a solution using bullet points to make things more readable.
