The search algorithms explored in the previous assignment work great when you
know exactly the results of your actions.  Unfortunately, the real world is
not so predictable.  One of the key aspects of an effective AI is the ability
to reason in the face of uncertainty.  
</p>

<p>
Markov decision processes (MDPs) can be used to formalize uncertain situations.
In this homework, you will implement algorithms to find the optimal policy in these situations.
You will then formalize a modified version of Blackjack as an MDP, and apply your algorithm
to find the optimal policy.

<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<div class="problemTitle">Problem 1: Value Iteration</div>

<p>
In this problem, you will perform the value iteration updates manually on a
very basic game just to solidify your intuitions about solving MDPs.
The set of possible states in this game is {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}.  You start at state 0, and if you reach either -2 or 2, the game ends.  
At each state, you can take one of two actions: {-1, +1}.
<p>
If you're in state $s$ and choose -1:
<ul> 
         <li> You have an 60% chance of reaching the state $s-1$.
         <li> You have a 40% chance of reaching the state $s+1$.
</ul>
If you're in state $s$ and choose +1:
<ul> 
         <li> You have a 20% chance of reaching the state $s+1$.
         <li> You have a 80% chance of reaching the state $s-1$.
</ul>

If your action results in transitioning to state -2,
then you receive a reward of 20.
If your action results in transitioning to state 2,
then your reward is 100.
Otherwise, your reward is -5.
Assume the discount factor $\gamma$ is 1.

<div class="problemTitle">Problem 2: Transforming MDPs</div>

<p>
Let's implement value iteration to compute the optimal policy on an arbitrary MDP.
Later, we'll create the specific MDP for Blackjack.
</p>

<ol class="problem">

<li class="code" id="2a">
If we add noise to the transitions of an MDP, does the optimal
value always get worse?
Specifically, consider an MDP with reward function
$\text{Reward}(s,a,s')$, states $\text{States}$, and transition function
$T(s,a,s')$.  Let's define a new MDP which is identical to the original, except
that on each action, with probability $\frac{1}{2}$, we randomly jump to one of the
states that we could have reached before with positive probability.
Formally, this modified transition function is:
$$T'(s,a,s')= \frac{1}{2} T(s,a,s') + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{|\{ s'' : T(s, a, s'') &gt; 0\}|}.$$
<p>
Let $V_1$ be the optimal value function for the
original MDP, and $V_2$ the optimal value function for the modified MDP.
Is it always the case that $V_1(s_\text{start})\geq
V_2(s_\text{start})$?  If so,
prove it in <code>blackjack.pdf</code> and put <code>return None</code> for each of the code blocks.
Otherwise, construct a counterexample by filling out <code>CounterexampleMDP</code> in <code>submission.py</code>.

<div class="solution">

   For one of many possible counterexamples, consider an MDP with three states:

   B &larr; A &rarr; C

   <p>
   Let A be the start state and both B and C be terminal states.
   Assume there is only one action (say, 'travel') to perform from state A,
   which takes you to state B with reward 0 (probability 0.9)
   and state C with reward 10 (probability 0.1).
   Intuitively, if we add noise, it makes it more likely you'll end up in C and receive reward 10,
   so the optimal value goes up.
   This counterexample is coded up in <code>CounterexampleMDP</code>.

Suppose we have an acyclic MDP for which we want to find the optimal value at each node.  We could run value iteration,
    which would require multiple iterations -- but it would be nice to be more efficient for MDPs with this acyclic property.
Briefly explain an algorithm that will allow us to compute $V_\text{opt}$ for each node with only a single pass over all the $(s, a, s')$ triples.
<div class="solution">
  Since the MDP is acyclic, we can simply compute $V(s)$ by using the dynamic programming recurrence,
  which goes over each $(s, a, s')$ triple once.
  The reason that value iteration requires multiple passes is that we don't have an ordering over the states.

Let us define a new MDP with states $\text{States}' = \text{States} \cup \{ o \}$,
where $o$ is a new state.  Let's use the same actions ($\text{Actions}'(s) = \text{Actions}(s)$),

Your job is to define new transition probabilities $T'(s, a, s')$ and rewards $\text{Reward}'(s, a, s')$

  The idea is to interpret the discount $\gamma$ as the probability of not transitioning into $o$. Let $o$ be a terminal state.  This admits two solutions:

  Recall the recurrence for the new optimal value:
  $$V_\text{opt}'(s) = \max_{a \in \text{Actions}(s)} \sum_{s' \in \text{States}'} T'(s, a, s') [\text{Reward'}(s, a, s') + V_\text{opt}'(s')].$$
  $$ = \max_{a \in \text{Actions}(s) \setminus o} \sum_{s' \in \text{States}'} T'(s, a, s') [\text{Reward'}(s, a, s') + V_\text{opt}'(s')]$$
   $$+ T'(s, a, o) [\text{Reward'}(s, a, o) + V_\text{opt}'(o)] $$
  Plugging in the definitions of the new transitions and rewards, we get that, for each solution:
  <ol>
    <li>
    $$V_\text{opt}'(s) = \max_{a \in \text{Actions}(s)} \sum_{s' \in \text{States}} \gamma T(s, a, s') [\text{Reward}(s, a, s') + V_\text{opt}'(s')] + \\ (1 - \gamma) \sum_{s' \in \text{States}} T(s, a, s') \text{Reward}(s, a, s'),$$
    $$ = \max_{a \in \text{Actions}(s)} \sum_{s' \in \text{States}} T(s, a, s') [\text{Reward}(s, a, s') + \gamma V_\text{opt}'(s')].$$
    </li>

      <li>
    $$V_\text{opt}'(s) = \max_{a \in \text{Actions}(s)} \sum_{s' \in \text{States}} \gamma T(s, a, s') [\frac{1}{\gamma} \text{Reward}(s, a, s') + V_\text{opt}'(s')] + \\ (1 - \gamma) *0 $$
    $$ = \max_{a \in \text{Actions}(s)} \sum_{s' \in \text{States}} T(s, a, s') [\text{Reward}(s, a, s') + \gamma  V_\text{opt}'(s')] $$

    </li>        
   <li>
    $$V_\text{opt}'(s) = \max_{a \in \text{Actions}(s)} \sum_{s' \in \text{States}} \gamma T(s, a, s') [\text{Reward}(s, a, s') + V_\text{opt}'(s')] + \\ (1 - \gamma) * 0$$
    $$ =  \max_{a \in \text{Actions}(s)} \sum_{s' \in \text{States}} T(s, a, s') [\gamma \text{Reward}(s, a, s') + \gamma V_\text{opt}'(s')]$$    
    </li>

 </ol>
  In all cases except for the third, we have recovered the original recurrence:
      $$V_\text{opt}'(s) = \max_{a \in \text{Actions}(s)} \sum_{s' \in \text{States}} T(s, a, s') [\text{Reward}(s, a, s') + \gamma V_\text{opt}'(s')].$$
    Therefore, the new MDP and the old MDP have the same optimal values.

<div class="problemTitle">Problem 3: Peeking Blackjack</div>

<p>
Now that we gotten a bit of practice with general-purpose MDP algorithms, let's use them to play (a modified version of) Blackjack.
For this problem, you will be creating an MDP to describe states, actions, and rewards in this game.
</p>

<p>
For our version of Blackjack, the deck can contain an
arbitrary collection of cards with different face values.  At the start of the game,
    the deck contains the same number of each cards of each face value; we call this number
    the 'multiplicity'.  For example, a standard deck of 52 cards would have face values $[1, 2, \ldots,
13]$ and multiplicity 4.  You could also have a deck with face values
$[1,5,20]$; if we used multiplicity 10 in this case, there would be 30 cards in total (10 each of 1s, 5s, and 20s).
The deck is shuffled, meaning that each permutation of the cards is equally likely.
</p>

<p>
The game occurs in a sequence of rounds.
Each round, the player either
(i) takes the next card from the top of the deck (costing nothing),
(ii) peeks at the top card
(costing <code>peekCost</code>, in which case the next round, that card will be drawn),
or (iii) quits the game.
(Note: it is not possible to peek twice in a row; if the player peeks twice in a row, then
<code>succAndProbReward()</code> should return <code>[]</code>.)
</p>

<p>
The game continues until one of the following conditions becomes true:
<ul>
   <li>The player quits, in which case her reward is the sum of the face values of the cards in her hand.
   <li>The player takes a card and "goes bust".  This means that the sum of the face values
    of the cards in her hand is strictly greater than the threshold specified at the start
    of the game.  If this happens, her reward is 0.
   <li>The deck runs out of cards, in which case it is as if she quits, and she
gets a reward which is the sum of the cards in her hand.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In this problem, your state $s$ will be represented as a 3-element tuple:
<blockquote>
  <code>(totalCardValueInHand, nextCardIndexIfPeeked, deckCardCounts)</code>
</blockquote>
As an example, assume the deck has card values $[1, 2, 3]$ with multiplicity 1,
and the threshold is 4.
Initially, the player has no cards, so her total is 0;
this corresponds to state <code>(0, None, (1, 1, 1))</code>.
At this point, she can take, peek, or quit.
<ul>
  <li>If she takes, the three possible 
successor states (each of which has equal probability of $1/3$) are:
<blockquote>
  <code>(1, None, (0, 1, 1))</code><br>
  <code>(2, None, (1, 0, 1))</code><br>
  <code>(3, None, (1, 1, 0))</code><br>
</blockquote>
She will receive a reward of 0 for reaching any of these states.  (Remember, even though she now has a card in her hand
    for which she may receive a reward at the end of the game, the reward is not actually granted until the game ends.)
<li>
If she peeks, the three possible successor states are:
<blockquote>
  <code>(0, 0, (1, 1, 1))</code><br>
  <code>(0, 1, (1, 1, 1))</code><br>
  <code>(0, 2, (1, 1, 1))</code><br>
</blockquote>
    She will receive (immediate) reward <code>-peekCost</code> for reaching any of these states.
    Things to remember about the states after a peek action:
    <ul>
        <li>The user is only guaranteed to take that card if they choose to "take" in the next round. The user can still quit or peek again.</li>
        <li>From <code>(0, 0, (1, 1, 1))</code>, taking a card will lead to the state <code>(1, None, (0, 1, 1))</code> deterministically.</li>
        <li>
            The second element of the state tuple is not the face value of the card that will be drawn next, but the
            index into the deck (the third element of the state tuple) of the card that will be drawn next.  In other words,
            the second element will always be between 0 and <code>len(deckCardCounts)-1</code>, inclusive.
        </li>
    </ul>
</li>
    <li>
        If she quits, then the resulting state will be <code>(0, None, None)</code>.
        (Remember that setting the deck to <code>None</code> signifies the end of the game.)
    </li>
</ul>
As another example, let's say the player's current state is <code>(3, None, (1, 1, 0))</code>, and the threshold remains 4.
<ul>
  <li>If she quits, the successor state will be <code>(3, None, None)</code>.</li>
  <li>If she takes, the successor states are <code>(3 + 1, None, (0, 1, 0))</code> or <code>(3 + 2, None, None)</code>.
Note that in the second successor state, the deck is set to <code>None</code> to signify the game ended with a bust.
You should also set the deck to <code>None</code> if the deck runs out of cards.</li>
</ul>

<div class="problemTitle">Problem 4: Learning to Play Blackjack</div>

<p>
So far, we've seen how MDP algorithms can take an MDP which describes the full
dynamics of the game and return an optimal policy.  But suppose you go into
a casino, and no one tells you the rewards or the transitions.
We will see how reinforcement learning can allow you to play the game
and learn its rules & strategy at the same time!
</p>

<ol class="problem">

<li class="code" id="4a">
You will first implement a generic Q-learning algorithm <code>QLearningAlgorithm</code>,
which is an instance of an <code>RLAlgorithm</code>.  As discussed in class,
reinforcement learning algorithms are capable of executing a policy while
simultaneously improving that policy.  Look in <code>simulate()</code>, in
<code>util.py</code> to see how the <code>RLAlgorithm</code> will be used.  In
short, your <code>QLearningAlgorithm</code> will be run in a simulation of the MDP, and will
alternately be asked for an action to perform in a given state (<code>QLearningAlgorithm.getAction</code>), and then be
informed of the result of that action (<code>QLearningAlgorithm.incorporateFeedback</code>),
so that it may learn better actions to perform in the future.
</p>

<p>
We are using Q-learning with function approximation,
which means $\hat Q_\text{opt}(s, a) = \mathbb w \cdot \phi(s, a)$,
where in code, $\mathbb w$ is <code>self.weights</code>, $\phi$ is the <code>featureExtractor</code> function,
and $\hat Q_\text{opt}$ is <code>self.getQ</code>.
<p>
We have implemented <code>QLearningAlgorithm.getAction</code> as a simple $\epsilon$-greedy policy.
Your job is to implement <code>QLearningAlgorithm.incorporateFeedback()</code>,
which should take an $(s, a, r, s')$ tuple and update <code>self.weights</code>
according to the standard Q-learning update.
</p>
</li>

<li class="writeup" id="4b">
Now let's apply Q-learning to an MDP and see how well it performs
    in comparison with value iteration.  First, call <code>simulate</code>
    using your Q-learning code and the <code>identityFeatureExtractor()</code> on the MDP <code>smallMDP</code>
    (defined for you in <code>submission.py</code>), with 30000 trials.
    How does the Q-learning policy compare with a policy learned by value iteration
    (i.e., for how many states do they produce a different action)?
    (Don't forget to set the explorationProb of your Q-learning algorithm to 0 after learning the policy.)
    Now run <code>simulate()</code> on <code>largeMDP</code>, again with 30000 trials.  How does the policy
    learned in this case compare to the policy learned by value iteration?  What went wrong?

<div class="solution">
   <p>
       The proportion of states where Q-learning's actions differ from the actions chosen by value iteration will
       vary slightly due to differences in implementation, as well as whether the simulation was run just once
       for each MDP, or multiple times.  (On each run, there is some randomness in the results due to the random
       exploration behavior of the Q-learning algorithm.)  In general, though, the expected ranges for this problem
       are 0-10% of states for smallMDP, and 30-33% of states for largeMDP.
   </p>
   <p>
       In providing an explanation for Q-learning's worse performance on largeMDP vs. smallMDP, the most important factor
       to mention for full credit is the fact that the state space for largeMDP is much larger than the state space for
       smallMDP.  Random exploration of (state, action) pairs over a large state space is often not sufficient to allow
       the Q-learning algorithm to learn accurate Q-values for each such pair, even with a large number of iterations.
       Q-learning does better on smallMDP because the state space is relatively small, so the algorithm is likely to encounter
       each possible (state, action) pair many times, and can thus learn more accurate Q-values.
   </p>
   <p>
       A secondary factor worth noting is that our identityFeatureExtractor uses features that are unique to each (state, action)
       pair, so our function approximation weights cannot be used to generalize learned Q-values to (state, action) pairs
       that haven't been seen.
   </p>

    Some common mistakes:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Mentioning the problem of feature generalization without mentioning the large state space for largeMDP.
            (The former problem wouldn't matter as much if not for the latter problem, as we can see in the case of
            smallMDP, where our feature extractor still isn't great but Q-learning nevertheless performs pretty well.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Highlighting the specific behavior of the Q-learning algorithm in terms of how and why specific actions
            differed.  A number of students gave an explanation about how Q-learning on either MDP was more "aggressive"
            or more "conservative" based on the number of times it chose to take/peek/quit.  Remember that the Q-learning
            algorithm has no notion of what it means to be "aggressive" or "conservative" in this or any other game;
            it simply tries to estimate rewards over a sequence of states/actions, but can't do that very well if it hasn't
            explored enough of those states/actions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Giving an explanation of how Q-learning performs worse than value iteration because it doesn't know the
            rewards or transition probabilities in advance.  While this is true, this fact doesn't offer us any insight
            into why Q-learning does a good job approximating VI on smallMDP, but does a relatively poor job approximating
            the optimal solution on largeMDP.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

</li>

<li class="code" id="4c">
To address the problems explored in the previous exercise, let's incorporate some
domain knowledge to improve generalization.  This way, the algorithm can use
what it has learned about some states to improve its prediction performance on
other states. Implement <code>blackjackFeatureExtractor</code> as described in the code comments.
Using this feature extractor, you should be able to get pretty close to the
optimum on the <code>largeMDP</code>.
</li>

<li class="writeup" id="4d">
Sometimes, we might reasonably wonder how an optimal policy learned for one MDP
    might perform if applied to another MDP with similar structure but slightly
    different characteristics.  For example, imagine that you created an MDP to
    choose an optimal strategy for playing "traditional" blackjack, with a standard
    card deck and a threshold of 21.  You're living it up in Vegas
    every weekend, but the casinos get wise to your approach and decide to make
    a change to the game to disrupt your strategy: going forward, the threshold
    for the blackjack tables is 17 instead of 21.  If you continued playing the
    modified game with your original policy, how well would you do?  (This is just
    a hypothetical example; we won't look specifically at the blackjack game in
    this problem.)

    <p>
        To explore this scenario, let's take a brief look at how a policy learned
        using value iteration responds to a change in the rules of the MDP.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            First, run value iteration on the <code>originalMDP</code>
            (defined for you in <code>submission.py</code>) to compute an
            optimal policy for that MDP.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next, simulate your policy on <code>newThresholdMDP</code> (also defined for you in
            <code>submission.py</code>) by calling <code>simulate</code> with an instance of
            <code>FixedRLAlgorithm</code> that has been instantiated using the policy you computed
            with value iteration.  What is the expected reward from this simulation?
            <span style="font-style: italic;">Hint: read the documentation (comments) for the
            <code>simulate</code> function in util.py, and look specifically at the format of the
            function's return value.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            Now try simulating Q-learning directly on <code>newThresholdMDP</code> instead.
            What is your expected reward under the new Q-learning policy?  Provide some
            explanation for how the rewards compare, and why they are different.
        </li>
    </ul>

<div class="solution">

    <p>
        You get relatively low rewards (approximately 6.84) for <code>FixedRLAlgorithm</code>
        because you are passing in the policy learned for originalMDP.  Because <code>FixedRLAlgorithm</code> doesn't
        adapt, the actions taken are not optimal actions for <code>newThresholdMDP</code>.
    </p>

   <p>
       Running Q-learning directly on the <code>newThresholdMDP</code> produces a policy with higher rewards
       (approximately 9.57) because it is able to adapt to the specific rules of <code>newThresholdMDP</code> --
       in this case, the higher threshold value of 15 (vs. 10 in the original MDP).
   </p>

   <p>
      Common mistakes:
      <ul>
         <li>Forgot to mention that Q-learning can adapt.</li>
         <li>Got incorrect average rewards.</li>
         <li>Reported rewards did not make sense.  (Some people reported that the reward for Q-learning was always 12,
             or they didn't specify that it could be a different value from 12.  This is incorrect, as the rewards
             returned by <code>simulate(newThresholdMdp, QLearningAlgorithm, ...)</code> are often less than 12.)
      </ul>
